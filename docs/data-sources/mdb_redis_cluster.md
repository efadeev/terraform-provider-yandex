# yandex_mdb_redis_cluster (Data Source)

Get information about a Yandex Managed Redis cluster. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-redis/concepts).

~> Either `cluster_id` or `name` should be specified.

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Get information about existing MDB Redis Cluster.
//
data "yandex_mdb_redis_cluster" "foo" {
  name = "test"
}

output "network_id" {
  value = data.yandex_mdb_redis_cluster.foo.network_id
}
```
