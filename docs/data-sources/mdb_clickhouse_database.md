```terraform
data "yandex_mdb_clickhouse_database" "foo" {

  name       = "dbname"
}

output "dbname" {

```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_id` (String) ID of the ClickHouse cluster. Provided by the client when the database is created.
- `name` (String) The name of the database.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The resource identifier.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```shell
# terraform import yandex_mdb_clickhouse_database.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_mdb_clickhouse_database.my_db1 cluster_id:my_dbname
```
