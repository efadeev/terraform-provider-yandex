# yandex_mdb_redis_cluster (Resource)

Manages a Redis cluster within the Yandex Cloud. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-redis/concepts).

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new MDB Redis Cluster.
//
resource "yandex_mdb_redis_cluster" "my_cluster" {
  name        = "test"
  environment = "PRESTABLE"
  network_id  = yandex_vpc_network.foo.id

  config {
    password = "your_password"
    version  = "6.2"
  }

  resources {
    resource_preset_id = "hm1.nano"
    disk_size          = 16
  }

  host {
    zone      = "ru-central1-d"

    type = "ANYTIME"
  }
}

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```shell
# terraform import yandex_mdb_redis_cluster.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_mdb_redis_cluster.my_cluster ...
```
