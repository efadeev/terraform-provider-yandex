# yandex_storage_bucket_policy (Resource)

Allows management of policy of an existing [Yandex Cloud Storage Bucket](https://yandex.cloud/docs/storage/concepts/bucket).

~> By default, for authentication, you need to use [IAM token](https://yandex.cloud/docs/iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token) with the necessary permissions.

~> Alternatively, you can provide [static access keys](https://yandex.cloud/docs/iam/concepts/authorization/access-key) (Access and Secret). To generate these keys, you will need a Service Account with the appropriate permissions.

~> "Version" element is required and must be set to `2012-10-17`.

## Example usage

```terraform
provider "yandex" {
  cloud_id           = "<my_cloud_id>"
  folder_id          = "<my_folder_id>"
  storage_access_key = "<my_storage_access_key>"
  storage_secret_key = "<my_storage_secret_key>"
  token              = "<my_iam_token>"
}

resource "yandex_storage_bucket_policy" "my_policy_0" {
  bucket = "my_bucket_name_0"
  policy = <<POLICY
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
